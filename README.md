# Motivation
One Million Pounds (OMP) is a react native mobile app currently on the google play store with a whopping six downloads. It is a weight lifting fitness tracker with the built in goal of lifting one million pounds (cumulatively) in as short a time frame as possible. After doing some estimates and napkin math, I set out to lift the cumulative one million pounds in 90 days. Using the OMP app in conjunction with my daily planner Daily Details, I hit 1,000,175 pounds on the 89th day.
